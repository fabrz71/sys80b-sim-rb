# sys80b-sim-prb
Gottileb "System 80/B SIM" pinball replacement control board software.
This software was developed and should be compiled under Arduino IDE on Teensy
4.0 microcontroller.
This software is part of "Sys80b SIM PRB" project which aims to design a
programmable replacement control board for Gottlieb pinballs based on System
80/B. 
You can find and contribute the PCB design here:
