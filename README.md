Gottileb System 80/b SIM pinball replacement control board software.
This software was developed under Visual Studio with VisualMicro extension 
and should be compiled for Teensy 4.0 microcontroller.
This software is part of "Sys80b SIM PRB" project which aims to design a
Programmable Replacement control Board for Gottlieb/Premier pinballs based on 
System 80/B.
