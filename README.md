# sys80b-sim-prb
Gottileb System 80/b SIM pinball replacement control board.
This software was developed and should be compiled under Arduino IDE for Teensy 3.x boards.
This software is part of "Sys80b SIM" project which aims to design a programmable replacement control board for Gottlieb pinballs based on System 80/B. The board is based on SIMulation design approach, verus EMUlation version (Sys80B EMU PRB).
